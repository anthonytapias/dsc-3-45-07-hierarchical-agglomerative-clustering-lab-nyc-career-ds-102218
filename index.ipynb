However, for thisn lab, we'd like to get a better look at exactly what is happening during each step of the algorithm.  To do this, we'll borrow some code from the book \"Introduction to Machine Learning with Python\", by Andreas MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guido--Andreas is the core contributor to scikit-learn, and the book Sarah and he created contains many great examples of how each algorithm works. In this case, they created several functions that we'll use to visualize the propagation of Agglomerative clustering algorithms (among others). We slightly adapted these functions and stored them in two `.py`-files in the course repository. \n",
